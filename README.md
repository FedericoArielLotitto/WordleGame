# Wordle Clone! üòÄ
![wordle](https://github.com/FedericoArielLotitto/wordle-clone/assets/62823425/61633e7c-3cf2-41a4-8556-c16f128cf04d)

This is a clone of the famous Wordle game published by the New York Times every day. As in the original Wordle, you can enter to the [Wordle Clone](https://federicoariellotitto.github.io/wordle-clone) in every resolution and try it.


## Technologies

This clone is built with VueJS 3 and Typescript, with Vite as a bundler. 
The list of words are the most possible I could collect and are persisted in a file in the same code's directory. 
Thus, you don't need a database set up (Mongo, MySQL or the database motor you like the most) to try the code.
I encourage you to do a fork and create one if you want to challenge yourself üòç!
